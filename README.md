ShutterStem is your photos everywhere.

With this project I'm trying to make taking photos fun again. It is a collection of tools for curating a CouchDB-based photo library that is extendable, syncable and scalable.

The goal is a reliable "personal cloud" for managing photo collections and maintaining the underlying image files. Currently it requires CouchDB and command-line expertise, but it's already got a good start on a basic organizer, a seasons-based navigator and a geotagging map.

If you want help setting it up on your own machine, don't hesitate to ask me in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/natevw/ShutterStem/issues) or via support@calftrail.com!


# Details #

Digital cameras make it easy to take thousands of photos; ShutterStem wants to make it possible to organize and enjoy the best —
on any devices that are available, desktop computer and travel netbook, online or off-grid, jailbroken or not.
To accomplish this, your photo library needs to be more of a /platform/ than a /product/.

In the ShutterStem system, metadata and thumbnails are stored in [CouchDB](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/why.html),
which means you can organize on any computer yet keep your changes synced easily.
Other apps, web or native, can build cooler features on top of this traveling database of images, without having to reinvent the basics.

You can [read more about the technical principles](https://github.com/natevw/ShutterStem/blob/master/PHILOSOPHY.md) behind ShutterStem,
or you just hop right in and start kicking the tires for yourself.

Contributions and/or focused apps that add their own metadata to, or rebuild an interface on top of the shared database are welcome!
(e.g. a Mac or Android or iOS–native organizer, a web gallery/slideshow viewer, automatic face detection...)

Any questions? I'm @natevw on Twitter, and @ShutterStem also has its own feed for occasional announcements.

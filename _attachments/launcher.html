    <h1>ShutterStem</h1>
    
    <p>
    ShutterStem enables apps that are optimized for organizing—and enjoying—a lifetime of photos.
    </p><p>
    It <a href="http://www.extinguishedscholar.com/wpglob/?p=767">grew out of</a> dissatifcation with existing tools for shutterbugs: chosing between either inflexible libraries stuck on the big computer at home, or having to somehow upload terabytes of life history to a hopefully-trustworthy cloud provider. I wanted better, and I suspect there are others (e.g. photojournalists or citizens in sensitive situations) that <em>need</em> better.
    </p><p>
    ShutterStem is ultimately envisioned as a scalable, syncable local network appliance. It will provide some polished core features like backup/sync, import/export/upload, basic organization/editing, etc. as well as an open API (with flexible schema) to enable custom integrations and extensions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Rough demos:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="seasons.html"><img src="ss_seasons.png" alt>Seasons</a>
            <div>
                <p>Traditional grid view reenvisioned to give users a feel for the overall "landscape" while navigating a lifetime of photos. Features a horizontally-scrolling daily histogram with seasons reminiscent of icicles and stalactites.
                <p>As with all the apps, its interface is designed to support both desktop and tablet browsers.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="organizer.html"><img src="ss_old_organizer2.png" alt>Old Organizer</a>
            <div>
                <p>First proof-of-concept, a basic clone of typical grid+albums consumer photo organizer apps. (The pagination sucked, hence Seasons above.)
                <p>Notice this app shares the same underlying data as e.g. Baskets below. A core ShutterStem concept is a single library supporting diverse interfaces: apps optimized for particular workflows and user contexts.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="_list/baskets/in_baskets?descending=true"><img src="ss_baskets.png" alt>Baskets</a>
            <div>
                <p>Experimenting with organization on very limited devices (e.g eReaders, etc.) and with concepts of how apps could extend each other.
                <p>The experience isn't great, but you can actually pull up this in a separate window (<a href="b_frame.html">or iframe</a>) and use it in conjunction with photo selections in the Seasons app above.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="geotagged.html"><img src="ss_geotagged2.png" alt>Photo map</a>
            <div>
                <p>Shows a map of geotagged photos, with concern given to scaling even when thousands of photos are in one location.
                <p class=badness>TODO: this doesn't show the photos/thumbnails themselves yet!
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/loctest/_design/loclog/summary_sandbox.html"><img src="ll_journeys.png" alt>Journeys</a>
            <div>
                <p>(This is actually part of a separate set of <a href="https://github.com/natevw/LocLog">location logging utilities</a> but shows an overview of data used by the geotagger below.)
                <p class=badness>NOTE: this requires sample data that I haven't added to this library yet…sorry!
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="geotagger.html"><img src="ss_geotagger.png" alt>Geotagalog</a>
            <div>
                <p>A port of what I wanted for <a href="http://calftrail.com/geotagalog">Geotagalog 3.0</a>, much easier using HTML5 and building atop CouchDB than it ever was versus Cocoa/iPhoto!
                <p class=badness>NOTE: this requires sample data that I haven't added to this library yet…sorry!
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="qcap_sandbox.html"><img src="ss_qcap_sandbox.png" alt>Quick Captioning</a>
            <div>
                <p>Quick-and-dirty start porting my ancient <a href="http://extinguishedscholar.com/soft/flcapt2.html">flCaptionater</a> app to ShutterStem. The idea is that you can get into a nice rhythm (describe, hit enter, describe hit enter…) and add text descriptions to hundreds/thousands of photos per session.
                <p class=badness>TODO: needs a way to navigate to a particular starting photo amongst hundreds of thousands (original app's UI didn't scale)
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="search_sandbox.html"><img src="ss_search_sandbox.png" alt>Caption Search</a>
            <div>
                <p>Super simple proof-of-concept instant search of captioned photos.
                <p class=badness>TODO: better stemming/indexing, nicer interface, etc. etc.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="tepui_sandbox.html"><img src="ss_tepui_sandbox.png" alt>Tepui</a>
            <div>
                <p>Basically unstarted, but the idea is to make a multitouch (and self-hosted ;-) version of the <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201201/goodbye_tabblo.html">now-gone Tabblo</a> — a site that let you layout photos and text in kind of a lightbox/scrapbook/webpage style, to share whole stories!
                <p class=badness>TODO: implement
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

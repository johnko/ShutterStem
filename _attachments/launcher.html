    <h1>ShutterStem</h1>
    
    <p>
    ShutterStem enables apps that are optimized for organizing—and recalling—a lifetime of photos.
    </p><p>
    It <a href="http://www.extinguishedscholar.com/wpglob/?p=767">grew out of</a> dissatifcation with existing tools for shutterbugs: stuck with either inflexible libraries stuck on the big computer at home, or having to somehow upload terabytes of life history to a hopefully-trustworthy cloud provider. I wanted better, and I suspect there are others (e.g. photojournalists or citizens in sensitive situations) that <em>need</em> better.
    </p><p>
    ShutterStem is ultimately envisioned as a scalable, syncable local network appliance. It will provide some polished core features like backup/sync, import/export/upload, basic organization/editing, etc. as well as an open API (with flexible schema) to enable custom integrations and extensions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Rough demos:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="seasons.html"><img src="ss_seasons.png" alt>Seasons</a>
            <div>
                <p>Traditional grid view reenvisioned to give users a feel for the overall "landscape" while navigating a lifetime of photos. Features a horizontally-scrolling daily histogram with seasons reminiscent of icicles and stalactites.
                <p>As with all the apps, its interface is designed to support both desktop and tablet browsers.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="organizer.html"><img src="ss_old_organizer2.png" alt>Old Organizer</a>
            <div>
                <p>First proof-of-concept, a basic clone of typical grid+albums consumer photo organizer apps. (The pagination sucked, hence Seasons above.)
                <p>Notice this app shares the same underlying data as e.g. Baskets below. A core ShutterStem concept is a single library supporting diverse interfaces: apps optimized for particular workflows and user contexts.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="_list/baskets/in_baskets?descending=true"><img src="ss_baskets.png" alt>Baskets</a>
            <div>
                <p>Experimenting with organization on very limited devices (e.g eReaders, etc.) and with concepts of how apps could extend each other.
                <p>The experience isn't great, but you can actually pull up this in a separate window (or iframe) and use it in conjunction with photo selections in the Seasons app above.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/loctest/_design/loclog/summary_sandbox.html"><img src="ll_journeys.png" alt>Journeys</a>
            <div>
                <p>(This is actually part of a separate set of <a href="https://github.com/natevw/LocLog">location logging utilities</a> but shows an overview of data used by the geotagger below.)
                <p class=badness>NOTE: this requires sample data that I haven't added to this library yet…sorry!
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="geotagger.html"><img src="ss_geotagger.png" alt>Geotagalog</a>
            <div>
                <p>A port of what I wanted for <a href="http://calftrail.com/geotagalog">Geotagalog 3.0</a>, much easier using HTML5 and building atop CouchDB than it ever was versus Cocoa/iPhoto!
                <p class=badness>NOTE: this requires sample data that I haven't added to this library yet…sorry!
